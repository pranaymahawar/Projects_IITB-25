Welcome to my repository containing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects done at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). This repository showcases my academic and personal projects related to ML and DL. Feel free to explore the projects and their associated documentation.

## Projects

1. **Image Classification Using LeNet(CNN)**
   - Description: This project implements the LeNet architecture using PyTorch for the MNIST dataset. LeNet is a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for handwritten digit 
     recognition. The code encompasses the model definition, data transformations, training loop, and testing loop to create a robust solution for digit classification.

2. **Dermoscopic Lesion Imaging (Inseption V3)**
   - Description: This project develops a diagnostic system for dermoscopic lesion imaging, leveraging the InceptionV3 model to address class imbalance and accurately classify skin lesions from a dataset of 
     10,015 images across 7 lesion classes.

4. **Fault Detection In Solar PV During ELectroluminescence Test Using Transfer Learning**
   - DesciptionThis project focuses on developing a robust fault detection system for solar photovoltaic (PV) panels during electroluminescence (EL) testing using transfer learning techniques. EL testing is a non-destructive method used to identify defects in PV panels, such as microcracks, delamination, and soldering issues. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and customizing them for the specific task of fault detection in solar PV panels, we aim to create an accurate and reliable defect detection system.
