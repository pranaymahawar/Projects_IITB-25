Welcome to my repository containing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects done at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). This repository showcases my academic and personal projects related to ML and DL. Feel free to explore the projects and their associated documentation.

## Projects

1. **Image Classification Using LeNet(CNN)**
   - Description: This project implements the LeNet architecture using PyTorch for the MNIST dataset. LeNet is a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for handwritten digit 
     recognition. The code encompasses the model definition, data transformations, training loop, and testing loop to create a robust solution for digit classification.
