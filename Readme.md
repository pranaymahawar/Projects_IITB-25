# Stock Market Prediction Model
## Overview
- This project aims to develop an advanced model for predicting stock market trends and potential prices in the near future. The model utilizes deep learning architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to analyze historical market data and generate accurate predictions.

- Objectives
Develop a predictive model for stock market trends and prices using deep learning techniques.
Utilize LSTM, GANs, and GRUs to capture complex patterns and dependencies in stock price movements.
Train the model on historical market data to improve prediction accuracy.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Components
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Sources: Historical stock market data from various exchanges (e.g., NASDAQ, NYSE).
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare data for model input.
2. Model Architecture
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Handles sequence data and learns long-term dependencies.
GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Enhances model robustness by generating synthetic data samples.
GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units): Efficient for sequential data processing, similar to LSTM.
3. Training
Training Data: Historical stock price data divided into training and validation sets.
Training Process: Iterative training of the model to optimize prediction performance.
4. Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Validation: Cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
5. Deployment
Integration: Integrate the trained model into applications or platforms for real-time predictions.
Scalability: Considerations for scaling the model to handle large datasets and continuous data streams.
